<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In this stage, let's challenge your code. Use optimal <code class="java">k</code> you found in the previous steps and your custom K-Means class to create the predictions on clusters for each object in <code class="java">X</code>. Then, you can use our function to plot your predictions (one 2D subdimension would do) or make yours. We asked you to guess how many clusters would be required for a great fit. It is now a perfect time to see whether you were correct.</p>
<p>The function we provided actually plots two images: one is your predictions, and the second one is the benchmark data so you can compare those and estimate how well your model performs.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Using the appropriate <code class="java">k</code> you got in the previous step (or by reusing your "find the appropriate <code class="java">k</code>" function with <code class="java">p=0.2</code> â€” see the previous stage), create predictions for each object in <code class="java">X</code> using your custom K-Means class.</li>
<li>Print the results for the first 20 objects for us to test.</li>
</ol>
