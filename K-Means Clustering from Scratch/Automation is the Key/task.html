<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Remember we told about the silhouette score in the previous step? It is now time to use it, too, to double-check the k you determined in the previous step.</p>
<p>We need you to use the <code class="java">sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score</code> to calculate the score for different <code class="java">k</code>. Since the higher the silhouette score is, the better the clustering is (for our case at least), we need to determine the maxima.</p>
<p>Do the same range for <code class="java">k</code> you did in the previous step. In case the <code class="java">k</code> you get is the same as at the previous step, you should feel safe about your choice. </p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Use the custom K-Means class with <code class="java">k</code> ranging from $2$ to $10$ (both included) and calculate the silhouette score for each <code class="java">k</code>.</li>
<li>Print the results for the silhouette score for each of the <code class="java">k</code> values.</li>
<li>To find the desired <code class="java">k</code>, plot the dependence of the silhouette score from <code class="java">k</code> and determine the maxima. Check if it is the same <code class="java">k</code> as you had in the previous step.</li>
</ol>
