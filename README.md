# K-Means-Clustering-from-Scratch-Hyperskill
This is "K-Means Clustering from Scratch" project form Hyperskill.<br>
Consolidate your knowledge of K-Means by creating a working algorithm from scratch. Find appropriate positions for clusters on the training loop, select an appropriate k to see how well the whole thing performs.<br>
In this project, you'll dive into implementing one of the simplest algorithms to cluster your data: K-Means. Explore it from scratch using only numpy, pandas, and matplotlib for visualization. We'll stick to the Wine dataset, so at least it will not be boring!<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
Files that were created by me is listed below:<br>
